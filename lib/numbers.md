# What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?

Fixnum (whole numbers without decimals) and Float (numbers with decimals)


# What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?

The basics incl. add, subtract, multiply, divide, exponential and modulo which I just learned today.


# What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?

A plus sign + used on a number will compute the value of the two added together, whereas on a String it simply joins the two for display


# If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?

It will not work;
remove the quotes so it doesn't treat it as a string


# What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

X.times is used to perform an action/process X number of times, which is not the asterisk/multiply that is used for computation
