# Prompt - Ruby

## Numbers

### Objectives

1. Learn about numbers in Ruby.

### Instructions

Research and then write answers to the following questions in **lib/numbers.md**.

- What are the different kinds of numbers in Ruby?
- What are some common operations and comparisons you would perform on numbers?
- What is the difference between the `+` operation on a number versus on a String?
- If you have a _String_ `"20"` and want to perform a mathematical operation (like division or multiplication) on it, will it work? If yes, why? If not, how would you make it work?
- What is the purpose of the `times` operation? Is that the same as `*`?

Remember two things:

1. You don't need to submit any code to us for this assignment. Just provide in-your-own-words answers for the questions above.
2. We're not looking for any kind of advanced writing skills nor any kind of length. Just be clear and thoughtful about what you write--organize it however it makes sense for you.

### Resources

As always, one resource is Google. Some of the questions above can by entered verbatim into a Google search, and for others that won't be as effective. Either way, expect to read (or watch videos) about more than just the simple answer to each question. Often a question's answer--even one that seems short or simple--doesn't really make sense until after you've read the paragraphs before and after it.
